# Weather App

The Odin Project - JavaScript Course Project 4:

A Weather Forecast website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app fetches weather data from the Visual Crossing Weather API to provide real-time weather information.

The app provides detailed weather forecasts for a specific location, offering both current weather data, hourly forecast, and 10-day forecast. It also offers geolocation input and toggling temperature between celsius and farenheit.

Note: It is bad practice to expose the API key. However, for this assignment from The Odin Project, it was acceptable as the provided API key is publicly available.
